That we propose in a very extended size-range, up to 46 and above. Our ‘Heels For All’ mantra is more of an invitation to play than a political statement. Although…</p><p><br/>We propose fine pieces, entirely made by hand, in Belgium. Pieces that bring together timeless craftsmanship and bold contemporary statements. Through continuous research and explorations, we develop shoes like stories: flowers suspended in glass-like heels, leather applications opening up to reveal a bright satin underlay… Or this time we tripled the size of a tiny pump by applying a fur-like sisal mat on it. It looked like it was bursting open.</p><p><br/>Truth is, we work to-order because we prefer a direct contact with our customer. It just seems best practice, and it allows us to constantly perfect our craft. As well as some freedom for artistic research.</p><p> So, sometimes we will surprise you with a product that has nothing to do with shoes.</p><p></p><h1></h1><h1>THE DESIGNER</h1><h1></h1><h1></h1><p></p>"
